### Description

ZNotes is a Zotero addon that will help you manage and visualize your notes. It is helpfull if you intend to make a systematic review directly on your Zotero by taking notes. This tool will help you organize your notes on Zotero. It will show you on a table what you have been writing. You can edit your notes right on the table or add new notes. 

### How to start a systematic review of the literature?

1. Create a folder (collection) to add all the papers you want to review (you can also use an existing folder).
2. Add notes to each entry of the folder. 
3. To each note, add a tag according to its content (e.g. Objectives, Methods, Results, Discussions, Comments, ... ). 
4. Right click on the folder you work on and open "ZNotes - My notes in collection" to see all your notes in the current collection. All your notes will be shown in a table with the tags as columns.
5. You may right click on the table cells to see what actions are available (Edit, remove columns, etc, ...).
6. Go to tools and settings to control the columns (tags) you want to show or hide. You may also sort the results (needs some fix in the next version).  
7. Export your notes to MS Word, Excel or CSV format.
